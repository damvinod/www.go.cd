<h4>Security fixes</h4>

In this release, permissions were restricted further on Windows installer GoCD server & agent folders. Thank you to
s7331 for responsibly disclosing this issue.

Additionally, we regularly upgrade dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities from third party software (regardless of
whether they are known to affect GoCD), so upgrading to the latest release is always recommended from a security perspective.
