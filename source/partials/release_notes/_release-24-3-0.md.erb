<h4>Security fixes</h4>

There are no security fixes included in this release (for issues known to affect GoCD).

However, we regularly upgrade dependencies to mitigate known vulnerabilities from third party software (regardless of
whether they are known to affect GoCD), so upgrading to the latest release is always recommended from a security perspective.
