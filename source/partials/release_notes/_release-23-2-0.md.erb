This release is mainly a maintenance and bug-fix release.

<h4>Minor changes that may affect plugins</h4>

There have been some changes made to GoCD's UI dependencies to improve loading times which may unintentionally affect
certain <%= link_to 'plugins', '/plugins/index.html' %>' views. If you notice a visual problem with a plugin view after
updating to 23.2.0, please update to the latest released version of the plugin, and if the issue persists please open an
issue on the plugin's GitHub repository.

A small number of third-party ___community-authored authorization plugins___ may no longer be compatible if they have not
been updated to declare compatibility with the <%= link_to_plugin_api_section 'authorization', '2.0 extension API' %>
and still use the outdated extension version 1.0 <%= link_to_plugin_api_section '#changes-in-gocd-19-3-0', 'deprecated in 2019' %>.
We have reached out to plugin authors for some of the more popular ones that need updating, but please update your plugins
and open an issue with the plugin author if you notice a plugin version compatibility error preventing the plugin from loading.
